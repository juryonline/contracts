# Jury.Online Contracts
This repository containts contracts for Jury.Online Responsible ICO operation.



# Jury.Online ICO
Contracts for Jury.Online ICO are a bit different from the general ones used for other projects at the platform. They are prepended with "JuryOnline".

In fact the differences are:
1. No need to handle JOT commission for our own ICO.
2. Arbiters are fixed for all InvestContracts.

can be exchanged for the original in 1:1 rate.
