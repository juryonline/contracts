# Contracts

This contracts are slighlty modified versions of general ICOContract and InvestContract. The differences are:

1. Preset arbiters.
2. No JOT commission.


# Tokens 
Jury.Online Token has been issued in November 2017, and will become transferrable after the end of ICO.  However for
Responsible ICO operation the project needs to have tokens to be reserved at smart contract balance.  Therefore for our
own Responsible ICO we're unable to use the previously created token, so we are creating another token which later can
be exchanged in 1:1 ratio for the original one.
